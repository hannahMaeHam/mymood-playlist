			<b>The mood of a song can be described in many ways. A song can be described as happy, sad, hopeful, lively, dark, epic, intense, and many more. <br>
			A mood is the feeling that you feel when you listen to music. It isn't always about what mood it makes you think of, <br>but what mood it actually puts you in. 
			Many songs have moods ranging from happy to sad and lonely to hopeful.</b></p>
